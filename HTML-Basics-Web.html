      <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
      <p>HTML stands for "hypertext markup language" and is a <i>markup language</i> used to represent structure data. Writing HTML doesn't need to be difficult, especially if you keep these ideas in mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="classA">
      <h2>HTML is a specification</h2>
      <p>HTML is a <i>specification</i>, or set of recommendations for how it should be written. It is maintained by the W3C and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/">you can read the specification here</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="classA">
      <h2>HTML represents content, not style</h2>
      <p>A web document has two primary components: <i>content</i>, which determines what to render on the screen, and <i>style</i>, which determines how to render that content. HTML is the part that represents the content of a web document; CSS represents the style.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="classA">
      <h2>HTML is made up of elements</h2>
      <p>HTML is constructed from building blocks called <i>elements</i>, which consist of an <i>opening tag</i> that indicates the start of an element, a <i>closing tag</i> that indicates the end of an element, and <i>content</i> in between the opening and closing tags. <b>Only the content is made visible when the page is rendered on the screen.</b> For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code> represents a paragraph element.</p>
      <p>An HTML document consists of a few key elements:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A doctype declaration (<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>)</li>
        <li>an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element</li>
        <li>a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element</li>
        <li>a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="classA">
      <h2>HTML is block-directed</h2>
      <p>HTML elements are <b>block-directed</b>, meaning they behave as though they are contained within imaginary rectangles that cause them to overflow to the next line in the page, forcing a line break. Some elements are <i>inline elements</i>, meaning they don't cause a line break to occur.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="classA">
      <h2>HTML structure is nested</h2>
      <p>HTML elements can be <b>nested</b> within other elements. This means the "rectangles" around HTML elements can be <i>encapsulated</i> within other rectangles. If Element B is nested inside Element A, we say that Element B is a <i>child element</i> of Element A; conversely, Element A is the <i>parent element</i> of Element B. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>HTML is semantic</h2>
      <p>HTML elements represent parts of a structured document that have specific meaning. Every <i>tag name</i> in HTML has a meaning that should match the type of content it is used to represent in markup. For example, the <b>&lt;p&gt; tag</b> is used to represent paragraph text.</p>
      <p>Here are some common HTML tags and their meanings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>h1 - h6</b>: heading text</li>
        <li><b>p</b>: paragraph text</li>
        <li><b>ul</b>: an unordered (bulleted) list</li>
        <li><b>ol</b>: an ordered (numbered) list</li>
        <li><b>li</b>: an item in a list</li>
        <li><b>b</b>: text that should be made bold and visually distinct from other text</li>
        <li><b>i</b>: text that should be made italic and visually distinct from other text</li>
        <li><b>strong</b>: text that is vocally stressed</li>
        <li><b>em</b>: text that is vocally emphatic</li>
        <li><b>div</b>: a section or division of thematically related content</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
